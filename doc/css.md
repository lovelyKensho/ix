# Flexbox

## Types of objects

- flex-containers
- flex-items

## Axis

- main axis (default: Left --> Right)
- cross axis (default: Top --> Bottom)

inline takes up as much spaces as its content

- `flex`
- `inline-flex`

Direction of flex items

- Some flexbox properties apply to the flex container only, while some apply only to the flex items.

- The flex-direction property applies to the flex container only.

- The default value for flex-direction is row.

- To reverse the direction flex items in a row, use the value row-reverse.

- The value column rotates the main axis so that flex items are laid out vertically.

- Like the row-reverse property, you can swap the top-to-bottom direction of a column with the value column-reverse.
